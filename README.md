# **The Dawn of a New Blue(sky) Era: Structural and Content Analysis of the Growing Social Media**
This repository contains the code and methodology for analyzing the **interaction structure** and **content** of the Bluesky social media platform. The study is part of the **Computational Social Science (CSS)** course and applies **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** and **Topic Modeling (BERTopic)** to understand user interactions and discussion patterns.

The dataset consists of **1 million public posts** collected from the Hugging Face repository:  
üìå [alpindale/two-million-bluesky-posts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alpindale/two-million-bluesky-posts)

- **The preprocessed dataset (`bluesky_processed.snappy.parquet`)**

üö® **If you are not processing the dataset locally, you must store it manually.**  
üì© If needed, **contact me** to obtain the zipped dataset and model, otherwise, the **SNA script will not work**.
